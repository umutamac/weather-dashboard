# UT Austin Coding Bootcamp - 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

This project is designed to retrieve current weather information and future forecast from openweathermap when a user searches in a city.

When user searches a city in search bar, the searched name gets saved into local storage and is displayed on the search list on the left side of the window. The system makes an API call to openweathermap for the given city in order to get and display current date, an icon for the weather, temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index, as well as a 5-day forecast with most of the mentioned information. If user clicks on one of the past searches, the system searches that city again automatically.

## Technologies and Tools
This project leverages jQuery, and it was a practice project to get myself familiarized with the library. There is also Bootstrap CSS involved in the styling. Lastly, as mentioned before, the weather information comes from Openweathermap API.
