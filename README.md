# UT Austin Coding Bootcamp - 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

This project is designed to retrieve current weather information and future forecast from openweathermap when a user types in a city.

When user enters a city name in search bar, the city name gets saved into local storage and is displayed on the search list on the right side of the window. The system makes an API call to openweathermap for the given city in order to get and display current temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index, as well as a 5-day forecast of temperature and humidty.
